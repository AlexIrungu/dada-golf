            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
           <div class="container mt-3">
             <p>Sexual and reproductive health is a fundamental human right as well as human development issue that communities must strive to fulfill. The Kenyan Constitution affirms that “every person has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to health care services, including reproductive health care.”</p>
             <p>Some of the leading concerns for women’s health are:</p>
             <div class="card">

                 <li class="list-group-item">
                   <h5 class="card-title">Heart Disease</h5>
                   <p class="card-text">According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 56% of women recognize that heart disease is the leading cause of death for women. While sometimes heart disease is thought of more prominently among men, the CDC reported that this disease was responsible for 1 in 5 female deaths in 2019.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li class="list-group-item">
                   <h5 class="card-title">Cancer</h5>
                   <p class="card-text">The three cancers with the highest number of newly diagnosed cases in Kenya affect the breast, the cervix and the prostate. GLOBOCAN 2020, estimates show that cervical cancer causes the highest mortality at 12% and among the top 10 cancers in Kenya, slightly higher than breast cancer which was at 11.5 %. Screening for reproductive organ cancers for men and women has remained low. The recommended screening cycle for cervical cancer in Kenya is every 5 years for women aged between 25-49 years with the exception of HIV-positive women who should be screened annually. Cervical cancer screening has remained quite low. In the KDHS 2014, only 18.8% of women 25-49 years had ever had cervical cancer screening. In STEPS 2015, cervical cancer screening coverage rates were similarly low, with 14.2% of women 25-49 years ever screened. Kenya has rolled out universal school-age girls HPV vaccination program after a successful pilot phase.</p>

                   <h5 class="card-title">Mental Health</h5>
                   <div class="card-body">
                     <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Depression</h6>
                     <p class="card-text">Depression effects the whole body. This involves one’s body, mood and mind. With this said, depression is more than feeling blue or unhappy and it is not a sign of personal weakness. It is important to recognize that depression is in fact an illness and just like any other illness, depression often requires treatment. While there is no clear cause, depression has been linked to chemical imbalances in the brain. In addition to this, environmental, mental health, physical and inherited factors can play a role in the causation of depression.</p>
                     <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Anxiety</h6>
                     <p class="card-text">Anxiety is a natural part of the body’s defense system. In fact, normal anxiety can be helpful as it works to alert your body of a threat. In this state, an individual’s feelings can often range from a vague sensation of worry to physical sensations such as a racing heartbeat. However, when an individual has an anxiety disorder, this response can happen at inappropriate times when there is no apparent threat. Anxiety can become an issue when it interferes with day-to-day life, is hard to control and occurs for months. With some anxiety disorders, the anxiety is way out of proportion to the threat that triggers it. With others, anxiety may occur even when there isn’t a clear threat or trigger. Anxiety disorders tend to run in families and are most common in women and younger people. However, no age, race or gender is immune to anxiety disorders.</p>

                   <h5 class="card-title">Sexual and Reproductive Health Issues</h5>
                   <p class="card-text">According to the World Health organization (WHO), sexual health-related issues are wide-ranging, and encompass sexual orientation and gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure. They also include negative consequences or conditions such as:</p>
                   <ol class="card-text">
                     <li>infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and their adverse outcomes (such as cancer and infertility);</li>
                     <li>unintended pregnancy and abortion;</li>
                     <li>sexual dysfunction;</li>
                     <li>sexual violence; and</li>
                     <li>harmful practices (such as female genital mutilation, FGM).</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p class="card-text">According to Dr. Mahmoud Fathalla, being a woman has implications for health. Health needs of women can be broadly classified under four categories (Fathalla, 1997).First, women have specific health needs related to the sexual and reproductive function. Second, women have an elaborate reproductive system that is vulnerable to dysfunction or disease, even before it is put to function or after it has been put out of function. Third, women are subject to the same diseases of other body systems that can affect men. The disease patterns often differ from those of men because of genetic constitution, hormonal environment or gender-evolved lifestyle behavior. Diseases of other body systems or their treatments may interact with conditions of the reproductive system or function. Fourth, because women are women, they are subject to social diseases which impact on their physical, mental or social health. Examples include female genital mutilation, sexual abuse and domestic violence.</p>

            <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="row">

                  <h5>Cancer</h5>
                  <p>According to the National Cancer Taskforce Report of July 2022, Cancer is the third leading cause of death in Kenya and the second leading cause of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) after cardiovascular diseases.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The annual incidence of cancer is increasing and was reported as 47,887 cases in 2018 and 42,116 in 2020.</li>
                    <li>The annual mortality was reported as dropping slightly from 32,987 in 2018 to 27,092 in 2020.</li>
                    <li>The risk of developing cancer before the age of 75 years (%) in Kenya is 18% among women and 14.3% among men while the risk of dying from cancer by the same age is 12.7% in women compared with 10.3% in men.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>The five commonest cancers in Kenya for both sexes are;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>breast</li>
                    <li>cervical</li>
                    <li>prostate</li>
                    <li>esophageal</li>
                    <li>colorectal</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Cancer prevention is reduction of risk of developing cancer through avoidance/reduction of modifiable risk factors, both at individual and at population and environmental level. One of the key issues identified by the National Cancer Taskforce Report of July 2022 is levels of awareness on prevention and early diagnosis of cancer in the community being very low. The health-seeking behavior around prevention and early diagnosis is also low.</p>
                  <p>Cancer early detection is achieved through screening and early diagnosis. The cancers selected for screening in Kenya include cervical, breast, colorectal (population level), prostate and oral (individualized screening).</p>
                  <p>The key gaps identified in cancer screening in the National Cancer Taskforce Report of July 2022 include the following:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Health system: fragmented screening and linkage to care mechanisms. There are challenges in availability and accessibility of screening services. Early cancer diagnosis services at public facilities are fragmented and provided in various departments.</li>
                    <li>Community level: challenges facing cancer screening include a discrepancy between knowledge and the uptake of cancer screening. Presence of myths, stigma, misconceptions and ignorance has affected cancer awareness and negatively influenced health-seeking behaviors. Cancer fatalism and attitudes towards seeking care when one is asymptomatic, have also contributed to the low uptake of cancer screening in Kenya.</li>
                    <li>Payment for screening services: All cancer screening services in Kenya are financed through out-of-pocket payment; this may be contributing to the low uptake of these services.</li>
                  </ol>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <h5>Mental Health</h5>
                  <p>According to Jyoti Sachdeva, MD, director of women's mental health at UC Health’s West Chester Hospital and associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the UC College of Medicine, women have one-and-a-half to three times higher rates of depression.</p>
                  <p>This means women are about twice as likely to have depression than men, as many hormonal factors and potential additional stresses may add to this increased rate in women. Dr. Sachdeva explains that women are specifically at risk during times of hormonal changes such as puberty, menopause, pregnancy and postpartum.</p>
                  <p>For instance, many women are at an increased risk after giving birth to a baby. In this situation, women have hormonal and physical changes in addition to the added responsibility of caring for a new baby. In some women, these factors can lead to postpartum depression (PPD). In fact, 1 in 5 women experience this.</p>
